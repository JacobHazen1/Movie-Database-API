# Movie-Database-API  
To make movie data more accessible to our target audience, we have decided to design a database that makes information on movies accessible and convenient. This REST API uses the Django framework. We also included scripts to create SQL tables, data, and stored procedures under SQL file.  
  
## Django Version  
2.1.7

## SQL  
There is a SQL readme in the sql folder, Im holding all the queries there

## Pip installs needed  
`pip install Django`  
`pip install PyMySQL`  
I use environment file to store my passwords. You can use anything you would like. First create a file `.env` then pip install the following:  
`pip install environ`  
`pip install python-dotenv`
